**Set up a virtual environment:**
It's a good practice to install Django inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
    
1.  Create a virtual environment
```bash
    python3 -m venv myenv
```
2.  Activate the virtual environment
-   Linux/macOS:
```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
```
-   Windows:
```bash
    myenv\Scripts\activate
```

**Install Django with all the dependencies**
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run the Server**
```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver
```

**To deactivate the virtual environment**
```bash
    deactivate
```
